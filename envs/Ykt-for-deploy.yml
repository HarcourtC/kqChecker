# Safe, minimal conda environment for deploying the long-running service (ykt).
# Notes:
# - This file is intended for operators/experienced devs. It intentionally uses a small set
#   of cross-platform packages and does NOT include machine-specific 'prefix' or platform-specific channels.
# - Review channels and dependencies before creating an environment on the target host.
# - Prefer cloning a tested dev env (conda create -n ykt --clone kq_dev) when possible.

name: ykt
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.13
  - pip
  - setuptools
  - wheel
  - certifi
  - urllib3
  - idna
  - charset-normalizer
  - requests
  - python-dateutil
  - pip:
      # keep pip pins in a minimal, permissive form to avoid strict platform/build locks
      - requests>=2.28
      - python-dateutil>=2.8.2

# Usage:
#   conda env create -f envs/Ykt-for-deploy.yml
# or (if env exists and you want to recreate):
#   conda env remove -n ykt --all
#   conda env create -f envs/Ykt-for-deploy.yml

# After creating the env, verify service runtime with:
#   C:\path\to\conda\envs\ykt\python.exe e:\Program\kaoqing\main.py --test
